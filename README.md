# Optical-Power-Meter (2012)
An optical power meter which is used to measure the power of laser. it is developed in c running on a C8051 MCU.

## Getting Started

The device is almost as same as the following one, it can measure the power of laser for different wave length, like 850 nm, 1310 nm, 1590 nm.

This is a Silicon IDE project, Silicon Labs or Keil uVision is recommended to develop and debug the code. 
  * Silicon Labs Integrated Development Environment (IDE) or Keil uVision
  * And a USB Debug Adaptor ![](https://www.silabs.com/content/usergenerated/asi/cloud/attachments/siliconlabs/en/community/mcu/8-bit/knowledge-base/jcr%3acontent/content/primary/blog/using_the_usb_debug-XeTq/images/8832b5dc-56ac-4f0e-a1d6-d2facba7f010.png)

### Installing

step 1. Donwload the code
step 2. Compile the project with Silicon Labs/uVision
step 3. Donwload it to the board and run it.

\* As it is hardware-specified, so it would not work on any board, so the installing is just a reference.

## Built With

* Silocon Labs or Keil uVision

## System architecture
The general architecture is,
